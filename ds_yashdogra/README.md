# Trader Performance & Market Sentiment Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between cryptocurrency trader behavior and Bitcoin market sentiment using data from the Hyperliquid trading platform and the Fear & Greed Index. The analysis reveals how market emotions influence trading outcomes, risk-taking behavior, and profitability patterns.

### üéØ Objective
Explore how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns with or diverges from overall market sentiment (fear vs greed) to identify trends and signals that could inform smarter trading strategies.
